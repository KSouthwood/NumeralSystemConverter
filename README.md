Numeral System Converter project in Java. From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).

### About

Convert a number from one base to another. (Hexadecimal to binary, octal to decimal, base 24 to base 7, etc.)

##### Stages 1 - 3

Simple programs to output a decimal (base 10) number in various bases. Conversion uses built-in methods to switch bases.

##### Stage 4

Upgrade program to take a number in any base and convert it to any base. Decided to stop using built-in methods and wrote my own conversion routines with special handling for base 1 numbers.

##### Stage 5

Add in functionality to now handle numbers with fractional parts.

##### Stage 6

Error-check all inputs making sure they're valid. Means making sure the radix's are in range, and the number to convert fits the radix.
